This morning when my thoughts
And my emotions were still a whole mess
I have stuffed everything all into my bag
No more, no less
Still, I just cannot be myself when I am in front of you
I wish I could but I cannot give you the words that I want to

During this night alone, I spread everything out as I unpack
But this painful feeling in my heart just kept stabbing me back
This love I feel inside, all of this love that I feel inside for you
It is too heavy, but this is all I can do

Our days seem so close yet so far, making me all dizzy
Temperature difference had my mind in a tizzy
My heart’s filled with growing feelings for you inside of me
I wish I could but I just can’t lеt them go
As much as I am in pain, I still want to scream out to you

During this springtime, I am watching you shinе
I am mesmerized, with this summer pattern and design
As this world that we live is changing
My heart stayed blue, this feeling only grew
In this autumn sky, with this snow combined
Every little thing around you fits you perfectly fine
I am totally deep in love like
As if I’m running around this busy life, no break to be free
We’re spending this season named under you as we see

I’m trying my best to reduce the number of things I lack
For some reason, they increase the more I’m trying to do that
It seems that I, who loves you from the bottom of my heart
Will never have the right to match your part
Words that I prepared to say
All the things that are in the way
They are being blocked by different me always
Everything shaking in this bag
They will just swell and they sway
It can’t even be left as a scar
Feelings I’m trying to hide so far
On the day my heart overflows
Just wanna let you know
Straight to your heart
Where my love for you belong

During this springtime, I am watching you shine
I am mesmerized, with this summer pattern and design
As this world that we live is changing
My heart stayed blue, this feeling only grew
In this autumn sky, with this snow combined
Every little thing around you fits you perfectly fine
I am totally deep in love like
As if I’m running around this busy life, with no break to arise
Tainted but still blue, yet clear as can be
Carry immaturity, heavily


Tomorrow, I’ll still try to gasp for air
In this spinning world that you live in without a single care
We’re spending this season named under you as declared

“Sun for a frozen heart”
And “I want to be in that position for you”
I complicated my strong arrogant assumption
Sorry, laugh at me

I noticed a coldness and viciousness of burning positivity
Probably something I want to give to you is a colder hot thing

It’s not fine-sounding talk
But something beautiful and unwavering
Something warms up the core in the center of your heart, not just the surface
I just have my ideal
But I can’t find it anywhere in my heart at all
I want to express but I fail to do so

This irrationality now binds everything
That this coward guy like me does tightly

Words are like snow crystals
Even though I want to give you them as a gift
The morе I get into you
The shapes collapsе, melt away and disappear

But the words I choose and my feelings in them
Cannot give up on vibrating your heart
Instead of “I love you,” wait for a little bit
For my love to reach you

I get sweaty unnecessarily just by standing next to you
While I’m dressed lightly
Anything I do is lukewarm and I end up hurting you

“A person with hotter palms has a colder heart, right?”
You may be joking, but don’t say such a cruel thing
You can say it, but let me definitely overturn what you said
Even if I need to bet my whole life on it

I want to save = I want to be saved
This equal sign now peels off gently both inflexible theoretical arguments
And overwrapping for pride

I want kindness more than correctness
And unlike illuminations for the crowds
I want you to be the only person who receives it

I tried to fix the broken cracks with my broken words
But my excessive energy pushed you to pull a curtain
After repeating my failures over and over
I want to find the best words and phrases one day

Words are like snow crystals
Even though I gave you them as a gift
They would usually overflow, melt away
And disappear from your memory as time goes by

But like subtitles that are always added to our stories
When we remember
When we abruptly take a quick glance
I want to keep looking for things that vibrate your heart
Instead of “I love you,” wait for a little bit
For my love to reach you

Even on frozen nights by sadness when you do not want any words
I selfishly think about many things by your side
They remain even after the snow melts away

Our love story, just as expected
When it starts, it's just a one-man show
Even though I was always by your side, I'm just in the audience
An apology without emotion, just like always
It's not so bad once you get used to it

My romance with you is how life goes
I knew it would never last

I wish I had chosen a different setting, a different relation
A different world-line where I could meet you
I wish I had been able to show my love in a different personality
With different values
But I know it's pointless

Goodbye
I'm not your soulmate
It hurts, but I can't deny it, but it's still hard to let go
It hurts just to touch your hair, but
It feels so sweet, no no

Goodbye
So, what are you to me?
I don't know the answer, I don't want to know the answer
If there's just one thing I know that's true, it's that
"You're beautiful"

Some self-important person lecturing about love
But nothing makes any sense
It's like seeing the nightscape of an unknown city from an airplane window

I wish I had chosen a different setting, a different relation
A different world-line where I could meet you
I wish I could have had that love come true, and told you "I love you" without any responsibility
With a pure heart
But it's an empty wish

Goodbye
There's an end line beyond the hand I hold
Every time it's prolonged, at the end of a tingling future
You're not there, and I cry at that truth
It's just too painful

Goodbye
I'm not your soulmate
It hurts, but I can't deny it, but it's still hard to let go
It hurts just to touch your hair, but
It feels so sweet, no no

Goodbye
So, what are you to me?
I don't know the answer, I don't want to know the answer
If there's just one thing I know that's true, it's that
"You're beautiful"


(If this is all the rules of romance, it's not so bad)
It's not so bad
(Eternity cannot make any promises, but)
Ah

"You're so beautiful"
