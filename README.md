# Higedan Bridge: Bilingual Lyric Engine
> A J-Pop lyric website designed to help Japanese learners bridge the gap between music and meaning.

Background: I created this platform back then when I was at JLPT N5 to combine my passion for a Japanese band called **Official Hige Dandism** with web engineering. 
Goal: Now as a Japanese learner (currently JLPT N3), I'm thinking about evolving this project from a static HTML site into a dynamic, single-page application focused on **UX Accessibility** and **Language Education**.

Key Technical Improvements
- **Dynamic State Toggle:** Replaced redundant multi-page architecture with a Vanilla JS state-management system to switch between Japanese and English lyrics instantly.
- **Integrated Media:** Embedded Spotify API widgets to provide a synchronized "Listen & Read" experience.
- **Semantic Learning Tools:** Implemented `<ruby>` annotations and hover-tooltips for vocabulary and grammar insights.
= **Furigana Toggle:** A button to show/hide all readings for advanced learners.
